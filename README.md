# Sudoku

Welcome to my Sudoku game "Under 10" where you will have to complete the puzzle in under 10 minutes while making less than 10 errors.

## Instructions

1. Click the number you want to input into the sudoku board
2. Click the tile you would like that number to go into
3. If correct, the number will be placed in the tile. Otherwise, it will stay blank and the error counter will increase by 1
4. Repeat until the board is complete.
***In case you were not able to meet the conditions, the board and timer will reset so give it another go!***
